The <canvas> and <svg> tags are both used in HTML5 for creating graphics and visual elements on web pages, but they differ significantly in their approach and capabilities.

    <canvas> Tag:

    The <canvas> element provides a drawing surface using JavaScript. It allows dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and interactive content.
    It doesn't have built-in shapes or elements. Instead, it provides a blank canvas where JavaScript can be used to draw shapes, lines, text, images, and more.
    Canvas elements are raster-based, meaning the graphics are composed of pixels. Manipulating a canvas involves updating pixel values directly.
    Drawing on a canvas requires scripting and is typically used for complex graphics or interactive applications like games, data visualization, and dynamic rendering.
    Example of using <canvas>:
    
    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="200"></canvas>
    <script>
      const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
      const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
      ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
      ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);
    </script>

    <svg> Tag:

    The <svg> element is an XML-based vector graphics format. It defines shapes, paths, text, and other graphical elements using XML syntax.
    It provides a set of drawing elements (like <rect>, <circle>, <path>, etc.) that can be used directly within the SVG tag to create scalable vector graphics.
    SVG elements are resolution-independent and can be scaled without losing quality since they are based on mathematical descriptions of shapes.
    SVG is well-suited for static or scalable graphics, charts, diagrams, icons, and illustrations.
    Example of using <svg>:
    
    <svg width="100" height="100">
      <rect x="10" y="10" width="50" height="50" fill="blue" />
    </svg>
    
    Both <canvas> and <svg> have their strengths: <canvas> for dynamic and pixel-based graphics, and <svg> for scalable vector graphics that are easily manipulated and styled. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the visual elements you want to create on your webpage.
